# Gunalan A – MERN Stack Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website showcasing who I am, the technologies I use and the projects I’ve built. The entire site is static (HTML/CSS/JS) so it can be served from any web host or straight from a local file-system.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Gunalan183/Main-Portfolio.git
   cd Main-Portfolio
   ```
2. **Open `index.html`** in your favourite browser – that’s it!

Optional: serve it with a lightweight dev server so relative links resolve:
```bash
npm install -g serve
serve -s .
```

---

## Deployment

Because the site is static it can be hosted for free on:

- **GitHub Pages** (recommended)
- Netlify / Vercel
- Any S3/Blob storage + CDN combo

To deploy on GitHub Pages:
1. Push code to the `main` branch (done ✅)
2. In *Repository Settings → Pages*, select `main` as the source
3. Save – your site will be live at `https://<username>.github.io/Main-Portfolio`
